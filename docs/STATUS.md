# Status

Updated: 2026-11-04
Phase: **2 complete for the x86 slice (OD-01, OD-02, OD-03, OD-04, OD-09, OD-10, OD-11 settled); AArch64/RV64 surfaces block on OD-07**
Owner: Mr-enthalpy

This file is the recovery point. A new session should be able to resume from
this file plus `AGENTS.md` alone.

## Phase board

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Environment, evidence baseline, docs skeleton | **complete** |
| 1 | Encoder boundary audit (XirAsm, LLVM) | **complete** for XirAsm; LLVM internals deferred |
| 2 | FMP v0 contract, schema, error model | **complete for the x86 slice**; AArch64/RV64 surfaces block on OD-07 |
| 3 | Three-ISA vertical prototype | not started; x86 can start |
| 4 | Invariants, negative tests, replay | not started |
| 5 | Convergence, route evaluation, roadmap | not started |

## Gates

| Gate | Condition | State |
|---|---|---|
| G0 | `llvm-mc` available and emits bytes for x86-64, AArch64, RV64 | **passed** 2026-11-03 (LLVM 23.1.2) |
| G1 | Three questions answered from source: x86 relaxation disable, RISC-V form addressing, AArch64 library entry point | **passed** 2026-11-03 (all three answered; see `90_boundary_audit.md` §4) |
| G2 | Every `EC-*` row has an observed counterexample and a decided carrier | **in progress**: the x86 slice rows are frozen (EC-01/02/03/04/06/07/27/28); 10 rows are still `draft` |
| G3 | Each ISA has >= 3 positive and >= 2 negative vectors passing two-source checks | not started |

## Decisions

| ID | Decision | State |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-0001 | Self-owned encoding core (Route C); XirAsm/LLVM are temporary oracles | accepted |
| ADR-0002 | Docs-first with explicit context anchors | accepted |
| ADR-0003 | Rust prototype, Level 0/1 output | accepted (provisional); OD-03 narrowed v0 to Level 0 |
| ADR-0004 | `form_id` carries every encoding decision; `encoding_choices` removed | accepted 2026-11-04 |

## Settled decisions (contract level)

| ID | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| OD-01 | Plan carries an optional per-instruction `expected_digest`; a hash, never raw bytes; a check, never an input | `EXP-0002` §2–§5 |
| OD-02 | Exactly two fixup modes, one effect each: `resolve_in_place` writes, `emit_relocation` zeroes and records; records are RELA-shaped; the mode never depends on symbol liveness | `EXP-0002` §6; `03_fixup_model.md` §5, §8 |
| OD-03 | v0 emits Level 0; Level 1 optional and deferred; Level 2 out of scope | `EXP-0002` §6 |
| OD-04 | `form_id` is a structured name resolved by exact lookup; a rename is loud (`E-FORM-001`, or `E-DEF-001` first); no opaque id, no `match`/`mask` | `01_contract.md` §7; F-09 |
| OD-09 | Exact integers with declared domains, no wrap, one range check per value after the transform | `01_contract.md` §3.1–§3.2 |
| OD-10 | v0 ships only the forms the slices use; the definition table is the feature surface and absence is `E-FORM-001` | `02_encoding_choices.md`, "v0 surface"; ADR-0004 |
| OD-11 | A byte-affecting decision is carried by `form_id`, a typed operand, a fixup field or a target field — never by a separate choice list | ADR-0004; `02_encoding_choices.md` |

## Open decisions

See `docs/fmp-v0/05_open_decisions.md`. Blocking items currently:

| ID | Question | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| OD-05 | Unknown fields and extensions | AC-10, Q10 |
| OD-06 | Definition digest coverage | N10, EXP-R5 |
| OD-07 | AArch64 encoding knowledge source | AC-03, AC-05 |
| OD-08 | Canonical wire form | AC-07 |

OD-07 has evidence but is not accepted. OD-06 is load-bearing: `EXP-0002` W1
shows that a definition drift the digest does not cover is caught only by the
weaker size check.

## Next action

1. Start Phase 3 (`ADR-0003`) on x86 only: the seven forms in
   `02_encoding_choices.md` under "v0 surface". Oracle bytes are already measured
   for five of them; `mov r64, r/m64` (`8B`) and the `81 /0` add variant are
   verified by disassembly because llvm-mc will not emit them.
2. Build, in this order: the definition table (one byte template per key), the
   exact-integer fixup engine (OD-02 modes, OD-09 arithmetic), then N01, N02,
   N03, N05, N07, N08 and N13 fixtures against the x86 forms.
3. Keep `python tools/check_ids.py` green after every change.
4. Unblock OD-07 (licence review) before starting AArch64. OD-05, OD-06 and OD-08
   are the remaining contract decisions; none blocks the x86 slice.

Phase 2 output: `EXP-0002` (OD-01, OD-03), `EXP-0003` (the alias pairs behind
OD-11/ADR-0004), the `pcrel_end` fix in `03_fixup_model.md` §4, the observed
relocation semantics in §6.1, ADR-0004 (OD-10, OD-11), the rewritten
`02_encoding_choices.md` with per-row carriers, the counterexample/retirement
sections in `04_errors.md`, and the OD-02/OD-04/OD-09 freeze: two fixup modes
with one effect each, a structured `form_id` with loud failure, and the exact
integer/address model in `01_contract.md` §3.1. The schema lost
`reject_if_unresolved`, `overwrite_bytes` and the one-value `bit_order` enum, and
`E-FIXUP-004` is retired.

`EXP-0002`'s plan-size numbers were measured with the then-required empty
`encoding_choices` list. ADR-0004 removes that field, so absolute sizes drop by
about 22 B per instruction; the A-vs-B comparison is unaffected in direction.

Phase 1 output to read first: `docs/fmp-v0/90_boundary_audit.md` (findings
F-01…F-15, gate answers in §4) and `docs/fmp-v0/91_reuse_matrix.md`.
Raw experiment records: `research/evidence/experiments/EXP-0001-*.md`,
`research/evidence/experiments/EXP-0002/README.md`.
